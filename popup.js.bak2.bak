/*
In process of editing to run as single injection for each submission.
Single button is new intent.

User should:
	1. Enter the student ID to submit into the popup.
	2. Click the submit id button.
	3. At this time, the script will check to see if a script has already been injected, and inject it if not.
		3.1 The injected script will then wait for a message from popup.js that will include a student id.
			3.1.1 When the script receives this message from popup.js, it will:
				a. click the current sign up Option
				b. enter that student id in the student id field (barcode I think?)
				c. enter the teacher name in the teacher field
				(d. eventually also click submit, but lets just make this much work first lol)
		3.1. Initialize the studentID variable in popup.js OR update it if it is already initialized.
		3.2  Initialize the teacher or update it if it already exists.
		3.3. Send a message to the injected stcript content to update the page.


I think more needs to happen, but this is what I've got so far.
I also want to build in console.log messages to be able to debug.


Could I actually just do everything from here? do I have to "inject" a script??

//First, get a live reference to the textbox from the popup.html.
const studentIdTextboxInPopup = document.getElementById('studentIdTextboxInPopup');

//Next, add a listener to respond to someone clicking the button with id: submitIDButton.
document.getElementById('submitIDButton').addEventListener('click', setStudentID);

//Now, lets declare the function that will happen when the listener hears the button click.
function setStudentID () {

	//We'll set a variable to equal the text from that textbox in the popup.
	let currentStudentID = studentIdTextboxInPopup.value;

	//Let's also print that current value to the console so we can check if needed.
	console.log("the currentStudentID has been set to %s", currentStudentID);

}


//Lets see if we can read that variable outside of that function above:
console.log("This is an attempt to read the currentStudentID outside of it's function: %s", currentStudentID);
//Okay, it definitely does NOT read that variable outside of that function. That was kind of expected.
//What if I make it a var?
